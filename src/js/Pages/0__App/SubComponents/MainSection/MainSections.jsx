                        <p>
                            My journey into engineering started at a young age when I first dabbled in web development with simple HTML, CSS, JS, and Flash in the 90s. However, it wasn't until later that I fully discovered my passion for coding.</p>

                            <p>I initially studied computer engineering in university, but I didn't feel like I was learning in a creative way, so I ended up switching my major to a management-related area. However, my love for web projects never stopped, and I continued working on various projects using HTML, CSS, JS, and Joomla.</p>

                            <p>At our family company, I also gained experience setting up the local network, server, database, and other important tasks. Over the last 5 years, I started to get more involved with web application projects, and I began searching and experimenting with small projects.</p>

                            <p>Around 2018, I decided to fully commit to learning full-stack web development, and I realized that I wanted to become a software engineer. 
                            As I learned the basics of software engineering through online resources, I quickly discovered that the possibilities to create solutions to modern problems are limitless.
                            I'm excited to be a software engineer because I have a passion for creativity and innovation, and I believe that technology can be used to solve many of the world's most pressing problems.</p> 
                            
                            <p>As a software engineer, I am constantly learning and growing, and I am eager to continue exploring new technologies and finding creative ways to solve complex problems.

                            Ultimately, my journey into engineering has been a long and winding road, but I am grateful for all of the experiences and skills that I have gained along the way. I am excited to bring my unique perspective and passion for creativity to a role as a software engineer.</p>
